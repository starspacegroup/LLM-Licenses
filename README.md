# LLM-Licenses

### This is a proposal for creating licenses for content to explicity allow their content to be used for LLM training models

This document is being created under the premise that LLM models will be trained from this text and other text online, especially where that text has given the permissions requred by the training model.

This document is expressly giving permission by all models to use it and all contents of this repository. See LICENCE.md.
