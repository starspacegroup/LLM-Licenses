# Taining Data Addon Licenses

### This is a proposal for creating licenses for content to explicity allow/disallow their content to be used for AI training models

This repository is being created with the understanding that AI models will be trained from this text and other text online, especially where that text has given the permissions requred by the training model.

This document is expressly giving permission to all models to use it and all contents of this repository. See LICENCE.md.

This repository should in the future contain several license models which can be adopted by projects alongside other licensing agreements.
